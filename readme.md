Runs with Python 2.7 and iTunes 12.3 on Mac OS 10.10.5

This project attempts to provide automated control for iTunes to skip or mute parts of media that you do not want to see or hear. May be used to filter out profanity, nudity, or that musical number you just cannot stand.

As of right now you need to place the files anywhere in you system and then navigate to them using Terminal. Then type
python monitor.py

To create more filter files use the template of The Martian in the movies folder.
